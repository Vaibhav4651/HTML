        <b>In mathematics, a theorem is a statement that is true. </b>A <u>proof is a sequence
            of mathematical statements that form an argument to show that a theorem is</u><i>true. The statements in the proof of a theorem include axioms</i>
        <mark>(assumptions about the underlying mathematical structures)</mark> ,<br><small>hypotheses of the theorem
            to be proved, and previously proved theorems. The main question is “How
            do we go about proving theorems?”</small> <del>This question is similar to the question</del> 
       <ins>of how to solve a given problem. Of course, the answer is that finding proofs,
        or solving problems, is not easy;</ins>  otherwise life would be dull! There is no 
      specified way of coming up with a proof, but there are some generic strategies
      that could be of help. In this section, we review some of these strategies,
      that will be sufficient for this course. The best way to get a feeling of how
      to come up with a proof is by solving a large number of problems. Here are
